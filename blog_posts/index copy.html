One piece of advice <strong>BE AGILE</strong><br><br>
  I believe the ability to be agile in life is the key to happiness. We stress our minds in different situations that we believe are out of our control.<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Serenity.png"> Stress leads to uncertainty and uncertainty leads to fear. If we can morph with the situation, keep calm during stressful times, and hit the curveballs, we would be able to believe nothing is out of our power. When we are in control, we have the mindset that life is going as planned which in turn, makes us happy we are living as we are supposed to.
</p>
<p>
  In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ---- x5 Agree
</p>

  I'm a pretty good cook. My friends know this and whenever they need a recipe or a new idea, they usually come to me for advice. Most recently, a friend of mine was throwing a dinner party and wanted to know what he could make that would get people talking. I mentioned a great honey nut chicken recipe...

  <h1 id="header">Comparing Databases- SQL vs NoSQL</h1><hr>

  <h4>June 26th 2014</h4>
<p>
This week we are diving into the deep end of databases, specifically SQL. This is our first experience with databases so I chose to learn about both SQL and NoSQL to make sure that I would use the most appropriate DB when creating my next program. Here are my findings on both DBs:</p>

<p>
<strong>SQL</strong>: SQL is a relational database which means it uses relations (usually called tables) to store data. SQL matches data by using common characteristics to place them together. The result is called a 'Schema'. SQL is a program that manages all the data that is found within the relational database. It let's you store and receive all the data that it holds.<br><br>
<strong>Here are the 4 main features of SQL:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>     A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.</li>
<li>     Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.</li>
<li>     Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.</li>
<li>   User can access data from the database without knowing the structure of the database table. <a href="http://robschwartz.github.io/blog_posts/week7_technical.html" target="w7tb">continue reading</a>

<h4>June 16th 2014</h4>
<p>
I am a practicing orthodox Jew.  If you had to guess, without knowing anything about me, what would you say I am good at? 
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew1.jpg">
<ul>
<li>A- Money Management</li> 
<li>B- Law</li> 
<li>C- Medical Science</li>
<li>D- Greed</li> 
<li>E-Comedy</li> 
</ul>
If you answered A, B, C, D, or E I would say you just stereotyped me. Without knowing me at all, just because I am Jewish, you would immediately assume I fit into one of the pre-mentioned categories. This is the definition of Stereotype Threat. It is when you are automatically categorized based on height, color, physical appearance, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>
 Labeling a person as a stereotype can immediately damage your view and relationship with that person professionally. There's a story in which a world-famous violinist...<a href="http://robschwartz.github.io/blog_posts/week6_cultural.html" target="w6cb">continue reading</a>

  <h1 id="header">Modules vs Classes</h1><hr>

    <h4>June 16th 2014</h4>
  <p>
The past week, I challenged myself with understanding and implementing Ruby Classes. This week we learn a new similar topic: Ruby Modules. The difference/ similarities between Classes and Modules is a pretty short list from what I understand. Here's what my research led me to believe:</p>

<strong>Modules methods have a global use whereas Class methods are private to that class.</strong>
<p>
For a more complicated answer, check out the graph below:</p>
<img class="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Module%20pic.png">
<p>
The Module function is Ruby seems like a good way to DRY. You can create a universal method that you constantly use and define it, sort of like how we define variables. Then when we want to call the Module, you would use the same syntax as calling a class.</p>
 
For example we would create the Module like so:

  <h4>June 11th 2014</h4>
  <p>
  Getting into Ruby classes has been a small war with many little battle wins. The first battle was understanding why we use Ruby classes.</p>
<p> 
Ruby classes are a fantastic way to create new objects with a pre-loaded set of methods (Learning about classes in CSS helped me understand this as well since I'm more of a visual learner). Instead of defining a method for each new object you implement in the code, you can just create the object into the Class and all the methods will be pre-loaded. I know, not very clear, but hopefully an everyday example will help explain it a bit better.</p>
<p>
We will be building technology for new product on the market- a tissue counter that lets you know how many tissues are remaining in your box.</p>
<p>
Let's start by ONLY defining our new class</p>
<!-- img of class -->

An Interview with Myself</h1><hr>

<h4>June 10th 2014</h4>
<h3> Topic: DBC Pairing and Feedback</h3>
<p>
I would first like to thank my guest for coming in today and giving me the opportunity to find out the deep thoughts and insight on the topic at hand. To give a bit of background, Rob Schwartz has been a part of Dev Bootcamp's Phase_0 for the past 5 weeks and is on his way to become a full-time full-stack developer.</p>
<p>
-Rob I appreciate the time and would like to just jump right in since I know you have a lot to work on and learn.</p>

<h4>Pairing:</h4>

The first topic I would like to discuss is pairing. You have had the opportunity to pair with some other students in the cohort, about 7 up until now.<br><br>

<strong>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</strong> <br><br>
 This experience has been great. First of all I love that we are 'forced' to meet the people in our cohort before we step through the door. It already gives us a sense of unity and helps with the conversion into the bootcamp. You are going to start the school with friends already in the door.<br><br>
In terms of solving challenges, it's been very helpful. As the famous quote goes '2 heads are better than 1'. On many occasions, my partner and I are at the same level in terms of programming knowledge. By putting our minds together, we can collaborate and share what we each know and have the ability to solve the problem faster than doing it alone.<br><br>

      <strong> Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</strong><br><br>

<h1 id="header">So Many Openings, So Few Developers</h1><hr>
	<h3>June 3 2014</h3>
	<p>
 
One of the main reasons I decided to change my life forever and become a developer is not only because I found myself enjoying learning and implementing code (there's something SOOO satisfying about writing a working function or building a complete site) but also because of the need for programmers. I currently work as a tech recruiter and every day there is a struggle to find people to fill our open jobs since everyone who can do the job is already taken!<br><br>
When I started recruiting 3 years ago, I was in limbo with what I wanted to do with my life. I majored in marketing, got a job in sales, was doing real estate on the side, and eventually moved to recruiting while still trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I figured recruiting was a great avenue to view a whole range of positions and speak to the people in the roles to find out if they enjoy their career and how they got started. Most of the developers back then has CS degrees and were life developers.<br><br>
This was a problem since companies needed developers and there weren't enough to go around. They ended up using off-shore resources that weren't as competent or a culture fit for the positions. This is an issue for a couple of reasons:<br><br>
1-      Off-shore developers usually means off-hour development<br>

<h1 id="header">Using Enumrable#map</h1><hr>
	<h3>June 3 2014</h3>
	<p>
Ruby is full of gems that are already built in the language that make it easier to use. As a noob, it's difficult to understand what each of these methods do and how to use them in a practical setting. They seem a bit complex compared to the if/else statements we're used to but in order to be able to use Ruby to its full potential, we must make use of the tools given.</p><br>
The method we are working with is Enurable#map. Before we understand what the method is used for, we must understand what "Enumrable" actually is, I had no idea before doing some in-depth research.
Enumrable is a built in Ruby module that allows you to implement a whole list of functions once it's included into the method. One piece I notice while doing research is that in order to use the Enumrable module, you must define your #each method first. We need the each method in order to tell the Enumrable how we want it to iterate over our input.
<p>
Here is the basic each method:

<h1 id="header">Thinking in Abstract Random</h1> <hr>

<h4>May 27th 2014</h4>
<p> 
In the beginning of DBC we were asked to partake in a test to figure out our style of thinking. I never thought about how a thinking style could greatly affect how you learn but it actually makes a lot of sense. Some people are "Monkey see, monkey do" and others are "monkey read, monkey do research, monkey experiment..." you get the idea. After taking the DBC test, it spat out that my thinking style is classified as Abstract Random. I have no idea what this means but hopefully I can shed some light on this for everyone.</p>
<p>
Doing a quick google search, Abstract Random style of thinking is defined as:
<ul>
	<li>30 % of the General Population falls into this category. </li>
<li>	You are a master of unusual organization systems that nobody else can understand. </li>
<li>You experience big emotional swings and are very sensitive. </li>
<li>You are person oriented. </li>
<li>You are very creative and divergent. </li>
<li>You take being challenged personally and are likely to just "shut down". </li>
<li>Best Career Choices: Marketing, the Arts and Research & Development </li>
</ul>
This outcome is a bit template for my taste. Sort of like calling in to a fortune teller where they say generic events and hope something has to do you with you. Some of the ideas are spot on, but some are a bit of a stretch. I feel anyone can mold themselves to fit in the points above.</p>
