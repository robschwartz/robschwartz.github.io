	<h1 id="header">So Many Openings, So Few Developers</h1><hr>

One of the main reasons I decided to change my life forever and become a developer is not only because I found myself enjoying learning and implementing code (there's something SOOO satisfying about writing a working function or building a complete site) but also because of the need for programmers. I currently work as a tech recruiter and every day there is a struggle to find people to fill our open jobs since everyone who can do the job is already taken!<br><br>
When I started recruiting 3 years ago, I was in limbo with what I wanted to do with my life. I majored in marketing, got a job in sales, was doing real estate on the side, and eventually moved to recruiting while still trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I figured recruiting was a great avenue to view a whole range of positions and speak to the people in the roles to find out if they enjoy their career and how they got started. Most of the developers back then has CS degrees and were life developers.<br><br>
This was a problem since companies needed developers and there weren't enough to go around. They ended up using off-shore resources that weren't as competent or a culture fit for the positions. This is an issue for a couple of reasons:<br><br>
1-      Off-shore developers usually means off-hour development<br>

2-      As we are learning in DBC, communication is key when working with teams, the distance creates an issue<br>

3-      Going off-shore gives you less control and also takes potential openings away from talented developers<br>

4-      Many more...<br><br>

This problem has been slightly rectified but the as we become more and more digital focused, the need for on-site developers has been greater than ever.<br><br>
This problem has been seen and has been rectifying itself with the emerging of boot camps and self- teaching programs. Everyday individuals can easily access these programs and teach themselves the basics of coding. The requirement for a CS degree has greatly deflated. What has become much more important is the soft skills. A company will make sure that not only are you capable of taking on the work needed, but you are a fit in their team and environment. Most companies are looking for someone who can pass, what I like to call, "The Beer Test". It's a very simple test, do you enjoy having a beer with this candidate. Think about this next time you go into an interview, since not only are they interviewing us, but we are interviewing them as well.<br><br>
I believe that in the near future, the shortage will be rectified by teaching the basics of code in grade school and giving children the opportunity to choose programming as a career. This fact makes me a bit nervous since some companies tend to get rid of the seniors if juniors can do the same objective. I see my career path growing into a management position to teach and lead the future. Tech is a ginormous field and there is room for everyone to find a home in it.
