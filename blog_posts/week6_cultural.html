<h4>June 16th 2014</h4>
<p>
I am a practicing orthodox Jew.  If you had to guess, without knowing anything about me, what would you say I am good at? 
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew1.jpg">
<ul>
<li>A- Money Management</li> 
<li>B- Law</li> 
<li>C- Medical Science</li>
<li>D- Greed</li> 
<li>E-Comedy</li> 
</ul>
If you answered A, B, C, D, or E I would say you just stereotyped me. Without knowing me at all, just because I am Jewish, you would immediately assume I fit into one of the pre-mentioned categories. This is the definition of Stereotype Threat. It is when you are automatically categorized based on height, color, physical appearance, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>
 Labeling a person as a stereotype can immediately damage your view and relationship with that person professionally. There's a story in which a world-famous violinist, Joshua Bell, goes to play in a NY Metra station in everyday clothes. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/violin_story.jpg">No one pays attention to him and either walks by or gives him a short notice of attention. The next night, the same violinist sold out Carnegie Hall where there average ticket was $100.</p>
<p>
I grew up in a Jewish community, going to Jewish private school and a Jewish college. Pretty much anywhere I went, there was a small Jewish bubble I stayed in.
My first real exposure to the non-Jewish world was when I started working my internships in college. It was a fantastic eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>
Before starting, I was extremely nervous on how they would view me since I was Jewish. Would they be surprised? Would they make me work past sundown on Friday into the Sabbath? Do they know anything about my culture or background? Maybe I should just try to work for a Jewish company and stay in my bubble. When I came in to work my first day, something incredible happened... nothing.</p>
<p>
Nobody pointed at my Yarmulke (head covering), nobody asked me any questions about my religion, and no one thought I should move to the finance department. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew3.jpg"> They just said "Welcome Rob! We're so happy you be part of the team" and they showed me to my space and got me started with a list of tasks. This was a classic case of self-stereotyping. I put myself in a category that I though OTHERS would place me in.</p>
<p>
After being in the professional world for 4 years now, I have made it my business to treat others as I would want to be treated. Donâ€™t see color, height, physical appearance or religion. Just look at their work and professionalism. Can they do the job? Are they polite? Can you see this person as a leader? What can you learn from them? The main rule of thumb is to be professional in a professional place and to judge people from what you know, not what you don't.</p>

<p>I can still always appriciate a good joke. :)
