			"All-In" is a well-known phrase in the poker world. It essentially states that one is putting everything s/he has on the table and is confident that their hand is the best (or hoping the confidence will scare the other player off, but let's not remember that right now). This is how I feel the experience at DBC will be. I need to go all in. Everything on the table. Shoot for the moon and land on Mars. My impression is that this is the type of culture DBC embraces.  To become the person I envision myself to be, this is the culture I need. Bold - I am not scared to work hard or to fail, these words are said and meant but that doesn't mean I won't sweat while I'm on the bottom on the journey to the top.

My expectations now and forever will be that DBC is the best program I could have joined to become who I want to be. I did tons of research, was accepted to 2 other Bootcamps in the city, spoke to multiple graduates, and convinced my wife (who is very supportive and getting used to me always working) to let me join the program. I have a responsibility to myself and my family to succeed. I am extremely excited to get in house and start working with others. As we read, it is better to have 5 heads working on a project for 1 day than 1 person working on it for 5 days.

I am nervous as hell and will be the whole way through. Confidence will be my greatest struggle but I am sure the support I get from DBC will help me gain the mindset I need to succeed.
