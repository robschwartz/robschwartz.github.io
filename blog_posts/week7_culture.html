One piece of advice <strong>BE AGILE</strong><br><br>
	I believe the ability to be agile in life is the key to happiness. We stress our minds in different situations that we believe are out of our control.<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Serenity.png"> Stress leads to uncertainty and uncertainty leads to fear. If we can morph with the situation, keep calm during stressful times, and hit the curveballs, we would be able to believe nothing is out of our power. When we are in control, we have the mindset that life is going as planned which in turn, makes us happy we are living as we are supposed to.

<p>
	In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ---- x5 Agree
</p>
<p>
	I'm a pretty good cook. My friends know this and whenever they need a recipe or a new idea, they usually come to me for advice. Most recently, a friend of mine was throwing a dinner party and wanted to know what he could make that would get people talking. I mentioned a great honey nut chicken recipe that people love and he was in. It was the day of the dinner party and he called me frantic, he forgot to go out and buy nuts, one of the key <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Fried-Chicken.jpg"> ingredients and he didn't have anything else to make the chicken with. He also didn't have much time. I thought for a second and asked what else he had in his apartment he can bread the chicken with, it wasn't much. He mentioned he had some cereal- usually make with highly "crumbable" material. I asked him what kind, and as soon as he said "Honey-Nut Cheerios" we both knew what had to be done. He turned the cereal into the coating for the chicken and it came out way better than expected, people didn't leave a leg on the plate and were talking about the whole next week. The ability to be flexible to life and the situation was a huge factor in keeping calm and getting the product delivered on time.

	My values were a major factor in my decision in joining DBC. I am in a job that has plateaued and I needed to make a change in order to grow with the world around me. Instead of waiting for the hammer to come down, I have took control of my future by jumping ahead of the curve. The fact that I have an agile mindset is helpful in understanding that there is always a way to get something done, regardless of what road blocks present themselves.

	I know there will be times when I feel like I'm drowning or behind or not as talented as the person next to me but I need to remember that there is more to us than code. We have personalities, we have knowledge, we have a life. In my experience as a recruiter, I have found that there is a position for everyone. Even if you go through 50 no's, there will be 1 yes- that's all you need, just 1. Be flexible and continue the mindset where you are in control of your career.
