<h1 id="header">IS THIS RIGHT?</h1>
<div class="content">
	<h4>July 7th 2014</h4>
	<p>On my short road to becoming a programmer, I have learnt an important lesson- You need to know how to ask the right question. <img class="jpg" src="images/Zoidberg.jpg">  It's insane how important this is. Knowing how to phrase your question could save you loads of time and frustration.
</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
 Imagine you are search for an answer, a method, a syntax question, or a simple little debug issue, whatever it is. You are getting answers, but not the answers you need. You find articles and blogs and code snippets that start leading you in the wrong direction and your code takes on more errors, more bugs, and gets further from being perfect.</p>
<p>All of this could have been avoided if you took the time to understand what you are looking for and how to ask the internet for it.
</p>
<p>
	Here are the steps to creating a "good" question:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: Make sure you can't answer the question with simple research</li><br>
<li><strong> Title</strong>: Make sure to title your question properly in order make it easy for others to find and answer it</li><br>
<li><strong>Write your story</strong>: Don't jump write into the question and leave it at that. Help people understand your question by putting them in your place. Include code snippets, error messages, links, anything that can make the question clear. You don't want to have people who answer the questions ask you another question before answering.</li><br>
<li><strong>Grammar</strong>: be sure to check spelling and grammar before submitting the question</li><br>
<li><strong>ASK!!</strong>: Some people are too shy or embarrassed to ask a question. If you don't ask then you'll never know. Coming into the tech field I have found that it is more of a community than any other field. People are there to help. How awesome is it to get help from real people instead of robots or programs!? As the community grows, the better and more answers you will receive.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Acknowledge</strong>: Everyone loves a nice pat on the back or thank you. Remember that they helped you stop pulling your hear hair out and finally reach that moment of completion.</li>
</ul>
