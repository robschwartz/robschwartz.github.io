	<h1 id="header">Comparing Databases- SQL vs NoSQL</h1><hr>
	<div class="content">
	<h4>June 26th 2014</h4>
<p>
This week we are diving into the deep end of databases, specifically SQL. This is our first experience with databases so I chose to learn about both SQL and NoSQL to make sure that I would use the most appropriate DB when creating my next program. Here are my findings on both DBs:</p>

<p>
<strong>SQL</strong>: SQL is a relational database which means it uses relations (usually called tables) to store data. SQL matches data by using common characteristics to place them together. The result is called a 'Schema'. SQL is a program that manages all the data that is found within the relational database. It let's you store and receive all the data that it holds.<br><br>
<strong>Here are the 4 main features of SQL:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>     A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.</li>
<li>     Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.</li>
<li>     Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.</li>
<li>   User can access data from the database without knowing the structure of the database table.</li></ol>
 </p>
<strong>Advantages of SQL Database</strong>
<ul>
<li>SQL base RDBMS are excellent in terms of providing atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability</li>
<li>It can very easily handle large volume of transaction with high level of accuracy.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
SQL is limited on its scalability and complexity since it needs to be stored on multiple servers that can be expensive and difficult to maintain. SQL also forces us to use a table to hold our information. If itâ€™s not in a table format, you need to change the data to be in table format which can be very annoying.</p>

Let's take a look at the other spectrum of the DB world, NoSQL<br>

<p><strong> NoSQL</strong>: NoSQL is a class of databases that veer away from the SQL structure. This has become more popular nowadays since these databases can be written without the stored data being in a table format. These databases are more of a "one size fits all" type format. The way the data is viewed/ stored without the table format is either document based, key-value pair based, graph database, or Wide Column Stored. This allows the data entered to be flexed into any type of schema without too much configuration.</p>

<p>Nowadays, we have been moving over to NoSQL since it has the more flexible attributes and is better at storing large amounts of data (big data).</p>

<strong>Here are the top advantages of NoSQL:</strong>
<ol> 
<li>NoSQL databases generally process data faster than relational databases.</li>

<li>NoSQL databases are also often faster because their data models are simpler.</li>

<li>Major NoSQL systems are flexible enough to better enable developers to use the applications in ways that meet their needs.</li></ol>

<p>
In conclusion they are both great Database programs for what they were built for. A developer needs to look at his project and the type of data he will need to store in order to understand which would be the better option. With all development tools, each has their pros and cons, you just need to decide which is more valuable to you.</p>

For more on NoSQL Database have a look at Brian's NoSQL presentation. It's funny!(trying to embed this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LhnGarRsKnA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LhnGarRsKnA</a> ) HELP!
