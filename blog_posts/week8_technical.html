	<h4>July 3rd 2014</h4>
<p>
	When I heard about the Ruby language, I first heard of it as "Ruby on Rails". Little did I know Ruby and Rails were 2 separate entities! Ruby is the back-end programming language and Rails is an <strong> open source web application framework</strong> which runs on and is built on Ruby.
</p>
<p>Great! So, what does that mean?</p>
<p>
	Rails is the application that helps Ruby become live on the web. It makes it easier for the program to run and helps programmers by offering templates to get them started with a web page. Rails is a <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> (MVC). MVC is a design that keeps different parts of the application separated into, you guessed it, Model/ View/ and Controller. The<strong> Model</strong> interacts with the Database, the <strong>View</strong> puts the HTML code to work, and the <strong> Controller</strong> handles the interaction with the web server.
</p>
<p>
	Understood, now how do I use it?
</p>
<p>
	Following the tradition of being user friendly, Rails offers the complete package just by downloading the Rails gem on to your computer. For complete step by step instructions and a complete package of Rails, you can visit <a href="http://www.installrails.com/" target="_blank">installrails.com</a>. For simpler installation just run this code in the terminal:
</p>
<xmp>
$ gem install rails 
</xmp>
<p>
	(<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">full instructions here</a>)
</p>
<p>
	I hope this guide helps you understand where Ruby and Rails differ and how/ why they are used together!
