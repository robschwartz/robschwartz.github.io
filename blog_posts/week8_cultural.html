<p>Conflict is a rare state for me. I am extremely passive aggressive and for as long as I remember, I have always shied away from verbal or physical conflict. That being said, not everyone is like me and I have encountered individuals that would rather fight that speak their mind. Luckily, I have never been in any fist fights but I've been a part of a few "shoving" matches in my life. One episode that stands out the most was between myself and a classmate of mine. Although I was young, about 12 years old, I was stupid and let my emotions get the best of me.
</p>
<p>The event took place when I was in 8th grade. It was recess time and as an 8th grader, we were allowed use of the gym. Our go-to game was floor hockey. Some students took hockey time very seriously. They had ice hockey sticks, pads, some even were smart enough to wear helmets, and I unfortunately was not one of those smart students.  The game started and it was getting heated. Goals were being scored back and forth, checking was illegal but effective, and name calling was at an all-time high.
</p>
<p>My team was up 7-6 with about 2 minutes left on the official recess clock. I was running down the court with the puck, looking like I had the clear shot for a game deciding goal. I wound up, marked my target, and at the last second- a defender swooped in and stole the puck away. I was fuming!
</p>
<p>At that moment, a switch clicked in my brain and I only saw red. The defender had a hold of the puck and was running toward my goal. I kicked it into high gear and jetted as fast as I could towards him. Payback was the only thing on my mind. He gets to a point where he <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/hockey_fight.jpeg"> was able to load up for a slap shot in front of the goal. Now it was my turn to crush his dreams. I jump in front of him, knock the puck way out of his reach, and feel something hit me directly in the face.
</p>
<p>I must have flown 5 feet in the air with my back to ground. I land and the world goes black. I woke up with everyone around me speechless. I feel supreme pain on the back of my head and in my mouth. I slowly sat up and felt the back of my head, there was a small Mount Everest growing. Next, I felt a weird cold feeling in my mouth, I took my tongue and touched the front of my mouth. What I felt scared me and confused me. My front teeth were cut in half.
</p>
<p>My actions that day shaped the way I will live the rest of my life. I will always second guess my immediate emotional response and think of all the potential outcomes before acting. If I could go back, I would have done things much differently. If I just took one second to think "how important is this game?" and "What good can come out of this" I would still have my original 2 front teeth and dodged many awkward moments of the future (mainly, my teeth being continuously knocked out).
</p><img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/patience.jpg">
<p>I learnt that the action- emotion- response time should be drawn out instead of immediate. There are many ways to handle  immediate emotion- take 3 breaths, don't respond to an email for 24 hours, workout, etc. Hopefully I never encounter anything like that situation again but if I do, I'll be sure to play out the conclusion in my head before reacting (or just wear a helmet).
