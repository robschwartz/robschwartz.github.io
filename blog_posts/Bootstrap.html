<p> 
In the beginning of DBC we were asked to partake in a test to figure out our style of thinking. I never thought about how a thinking style could greatly affect how you learn but it actually makes a lot of sense. Some people are "Monkey see, monkey do" and others are "monkey read, monkey do research, monkey experiment..." you get the idea. After taking the DBC test, it spat out that my thinking style is classified as Abstract Random. I have no idea what this means but hopefully I can shed some light on this for everyone.</p>
<p>
Doing a quick google search, Abstract Random style of thinking is defined as:
<ul>
  <li>30 % of the General Population falls into this category. </li>
<li>  You are a master of unusual organization systems that nobody else can understand. </li>
<li>You experience big emotional swings and are very sensitive. </li>
<li>You are person oriented. </li>
<li>You are very creative and divergent. </li>
<li>You take being challenged personally and are likely to just "shut down". </li>
<li>Best Career Choices: Marketing, the Arts and Research & Development </li>
</ul>
This outcome is a bit template for my taste. Sort of like calling in to a fortune teller where they say generic events and hope something has to do you with you. Some of the ideas are spot on, but some are a bit of a stretch. I feel anyone can mold themselves to fit in the points above.</p>
Let's try one more:
<ul>
<li> Frequent feedback - to answer the question, "Am I on the right track?"</li>
<li>Ability to use their creativity - "I know what you want, but can I do it my way?"</li>
<li>Teamwork and collaboration</li>
<li>Acceptance and validation of their feelings</li> 
<li>Freedom from conflict</li> 
 <li>Ability to be spontaneous</li>
<li>Appreciation for their efforts</li>
<li>Freedom from competition</li>
<li>The ability to revise midstream once they have new information</li>
<li>Personalized learning that allows them to use their strengths</li>
<li>Relevance to people, to them</li>
</ul>
<p>This is much better. I feel like I can take the bullets from this source and really relate to them.</p>

<p>The biggest struggle I've had in Phase_0 is knowing if I am on the right path to success. We have been doing all this work and the only feedback we get is from our peers. What if I'm learning something completely the wrong way!? I like that with HTML/CSS you can see the work live and you know yourself if it is acting the way you want- frequent feedback.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I have to start having more faith in myself and my skills. It's nice to view other firecracker's blogs and posts since it allows you to mentally rank yourself among the others in the group. Understanding and defining my learning style was the first step. Second will be to use best practices to learn the best way that is tailored to my thinking.</p>
