<h3> Topic: DBC Pairing and Feedback</h3>
<p>
I would first like to thank my guest for coming in today and giving me the opportunity to find out the deep thoughts and insight on the topic at hand. To give a bit of background, Rob Schwartz has been a part of Dev Bootcamp's Phase_0 for the past 5 weeks and is on his way to become a full-time full-stack developer.</p>
<p>
-Rob I appreciate the time and would like to just jump right in since I know you have a lot to work on and learn.</p>

<h4>Pairing:</h4>

The first topic I would like to discuss is pairing. You have had the opportunity to pair with some other students in the cohort, about 7 up until now.<br><br>

<strong>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</strong> <br><br>
 This experience has been great. First of all I love that we are 'forced' to meet the people in our cohort before we step through the door. It already gives us a sense of unity and helps with the conversion into the bootcamp. You are going to start the school with friends already in the door.<br><br>
In terms of solving challenges, it's been very helpful. As the famous quote goes '2 heads are better than 1'. On many occasions, my partner and I are at the same level in terms of programming knowledge. By putting our minds together, we can collaborate and share what we each know and have the ability to solve the problem faster than doing it alone.<br><br>

      <strong> Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</strong><br><br>

It's always rewarding when you are able to complete the challenge together. We share aha moments and we both feel that we wouldn't have gotten there without the others help.<br><br>

<strong>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</strong><br><br>

Sometimes it's frustrating when your partner knows a bit more than you and wants to play both navigator and driver. This has happened before and even though I learn what they are doing, I feel it would be a better experience if we stuck to the roles we laid out.
<br><br>
<h3> Feedback</h3>
The next topic we will discuss is feedback. After the pairing session, you need to leave a bit of feedback on the session completed. <br><br>

<strong>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</strong> <br><br>
Some were pleasing and some were helpful. There was one that made me realize I need to do a better job at speaking up when I'm supposed to. Sometimes itâ€™s tough to speak up when I'm not sure how to solve the problem but it's better to share your though than keep it a secret. Sometimes speaking your mind help you arrive at the answer.<br><br>

<strong>  Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</strong> <br><br>

The feedback wasn't really helpful in terms of learning, it was more about seeing how others viewed you in a situation.<br><br>

 <strong>  Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</strong><br><br>

Based on the feedback, I'll try to be more open and communicate when I see necessary. Doing the pairing over google hangouts is a bit tough since there is lag time and it might seem like we are each trying to speak over each other. I'm sure the pairing will be much more fluid in person.<br><br>

<strong>  How was it to write feedback?</strong> <br><br>

Writing feedback is a bit awkward. Even though it is anonymous, I tend to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and think they are giving it their all when pairing. No one wants to waste their time when getting together so I assume everyone has the same agenda.<br><br>

<strong>      What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</strong>  <br><br>
The most difficult part is giving actionable feedback. Giving this feedback forces you to find a flaw in the session. Sometimes it's a flawless session but then you would get a bad score for the actionable section.<br><br>

<strong> Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</strong>
<br><br>

I really enjoy pairing. I have learnt a lot and had a great time working with different people who I will spending more time with in the cohort. When we pair, everyone gains. Even if you are more senior, you use it as a refresher. We will be pairing mainly every day in the real world so this is great practice and a way to build our foundation on how to act in pairing sessions.
