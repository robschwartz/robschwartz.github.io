	<h3>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h3>

One of the most frustrating concepts for my personal growth as a developer has been grasping the idea of positioning on CSS.  Do I want the image to be Relative? Absolute? Fixed? Float? Absolute in relative? What does it all mean! Then once I figure out WHERE I want it to go, I need to figure out HOW I actually get it there! It's a journey of a process but little by little I am learning more about positioning and what each one means.<br>

Here is a quick guide to understanding CSS positioning.<br><br>

*First thing to note is all CSS starts in a static position. There are preset rules that are engrained in CSS that puts your HTML as it lays. No fancy positioning, just like typing on a typewriter.<br><br>


<strong>Relative</strong>: Using relative positioning will allow you to move the block up, down, left or right relative to the webpage or the div you are working within. Remember that when you add in your numbers that it translates to, "I want the block this many pixels away from that side". So having a block Left: 20px, Top: 30px, it will show something like this:<br>

<strong>Absolute</strong>: This type of positioning brings your item out of any div or block and puts it exactly where you want it to be on the webpage. If it was using space inside another block, it will give up its space to the items below it. Absolute position can be useful but you be careful since it can change the whole dynamic and design of the page. You also have to make sure it is not positioned on top of other items since it will overlap them. There is a way to fix this but we will discuss that another time.<br>

<strong>Fixed</strong> : Fixed positioning is like that little thing in your eye that floats there no matter where you look. It is setting an element to a position and it will stay at that position no matter where you scroll on the screen. You have probably seen fixed positioning in action before but haven't noticed it. A good example of this can be seen here:<br>

I hope this bit of information broke it down for you and helped you understand the different types of positioning available. The best way to learn is by playing around with CSS and plugging in all the different styles to see what they do live. This is scratching the base of the mountain in terms of positioning but hopefully it helps on the journey to the top.
