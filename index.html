One piece of advice <strong>BE AGILE</strong><br><br>
    I believe the ability to be agile in life is the key to happiness. We stress our minds in different situations that we believe are out of our control.<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Serenity.png"> Stress leads to uncertainty and uncertainty leads to fear. If we can morph with the situation, keep calm during stressful times, and hit the curveballs, we would be able to believe nothing is out of our power. When we are in control, we have the mindset that life is going as planned which in turn, makes us happy we are living as we are supposed to.
</p>
<p>
    In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ---- x5 Agree
</p>
<p>
    I'm a pretty good cook. My friends know this and whenever they need a recipe or a new idea, they usually come to me for advice. Most recently, a friend of mine was throwing a dinner party and wanted to know what he could make that would get people talking. I mentioned a great honey nut chicken recipe that people love and he was in. It was the day of the dinner party and he called me frantic, he forgot to go out and buy nuts, one of the key <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Fried-Chicken.jpg"> ingredients and he didn't have anything else to make the chicken with. He also didn't have much time. I thought for a second and asked what else he had in his apartment he can bread the chicken with, it wasn't much. He mentioned he had some cereal- usually make with highly "crumbable" material. I asked him what kind, and as soon as he said "Honey-Nut Cheerios" we both knew what had to be done. He turned the cereal into the coating for the chicken and it came out way better than expected, people didn't leave a leg on the plate and were talking about the whole next week. The ability to be flexible to life and the situation was a huge factor in keeping calm and getting the product delivered on time.
</p>

<p>
    My values were a major factor in my decision in joining DBC. I am in a job that has plateaued and I needed to make a change in order to grow with the world around me. Instead of waiting for the hammer to come down, I have took control of my future by jumping ahead of the curve. The fact that I have an agile mindset is helpful in understanding that there is always a way to get something done, regardless of what road blocks present themselves.
</p>
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/curveball.jpeg">
<p>
    I know there will be times when I feel like I'm drowning or behind or not as talented as the person next to me but I need to remember that there is more to us than code. We have personalities, we have knowledge, we have a life. In my experience as a recruiter, I have found that there is a position for everyone. Even if you go through 50 no's, there will be 1 yes- that's all you need, just 1. Be flexible and continue the mindset where you are in control of your career.

                            <h2>Comparing Databases- SQL vs NoSQL</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">
    <div class="content">
    <h4>June 26th 2014</h4>
<p>
This week we are diving into the deep end of databases, specifically SQL. This is our first experience with databases so I chose to learn about both SQL and NoSQL to make sure that I would use the most appropriate DB when creating my next program. Here are my findings on both DBs:</p>
<!-- (Add pic) -->
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/NOSQL_vs_SQL.png">
<p>
<strong>SQL</strong>: SQL is a relational database which means it uses relations (usually called tables) to store data. SQL matches data by using common characteristics to place them together. The result is called a 'Schema'. SQL is a program that manages all the data that is found within the relational database. It let's you store and receive all the data that it holds.<br><br>
<strong>Here are the 4 main features of SQL:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>     A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.</li>
<li>     Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.</li>
<li>     Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.</li>
<li>   User can access data from the database without knowing the structure of the database table.</li></ol>
 </p>
<strong>Advantages of SQL Database</strong>
<ul>
<li>SQL base RDBMS are excellent in terms of providing atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability</li>
<li>It can very easily handle large volume of transaction with high level of accuracy.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
SQL is limited on its scalability and complexity since it needs to be stored on multiple servers that can be expensive and difficult to maintain. SQL also forces us to use a table to hold our information. If it’s not in a table format, you need to change the data to be in table format which can be very annoying.</p>

Let's take a look at the other spectrum of the DB world, NoSQL<br>
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/nosql.png">
<p><strong> NoSQL</strong>: NoSQL is a class of databases that veer away from the SQL structure. This has become more popular nowadays since these databases can be written without the stored data being in a table format. These databases are more of a "one size fits all" type format. The way the data is viewed/ stored without the table format is either document based, key-value pair based, graph database, or Wide Column Stored. This allows the data entered to be flexed into any type of schema without too much configuration.</p>
<!-- (Put img of diff data pics) -->


<p>Nowadays, we have been moving over to NoSQL since it has the more flexible attributes and is better at storing large amounts of data (big data).</p>

<strong>Here are the top advantages of NoSQL:</strong>
<ol> 
<li>NoSQL databases generally process data faster than relational databases.</li>

<li>NoSQL databases are also often faster because their data models are simpler.</li>

<li>Major NoSQL systems are flexible enough to better enable developers to use the applications in ways that meet their needs.</li></ol>

<!-- Pic of boxers facing off -->
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/facing_off_sql.jpg">
<p>
In conclusion they are both great Database programs for what they were built for. A developer needs to look at his project and the type of data he will need to store in order to understand which would be the better option. With all development tools, each has their pros and cons, you just need to decide which is more valuable to you.</p>
<p>
For more on NoSQL Database have a look at Brian's NoSQL presentation. It's funny!

<p>
I am a practicing orthodox Jew.  If you had to guess, without knowing anything about me, what would you say I am good at? 
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew1.jpg">
<ul>
<li>A- Money Management</li> 
<li>B- Law</li> 
<li>C- Medical Science</li>
<li>D- Greed</li> 
<li>E-Comedy</li> 
</ul>
If you answered A, B, C, D, or E I would say you just stereotyped me. Without knowing me at all, just because I am Jewish, you would immediately assume I fit into one of the pre-mentioned categories. This is the definition of Stereotype Threat. It is when you are automatically categorized based on height, color, physical appearance, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>
 Labeling a person as a stereotype can immediately damage your view and relationship with that person professionally. There's a story in which a world-famous violinist, Joshua Bell, goes to play in a NY Metra station in everyday clothes. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/violin_story.jpg">No one pays attention to him and either walks by or gives him a short notice of attention. The next night, the same violinist sold out Carnegie Hall where there average ticket was $100.</p>
<p>
I grew up in a Jewish community, going to Jewish private school and a Jewish college. Pretty much anywhere I went, there was a small Jewish bubble I stayed in.
My first real exposure to the non-Jewish world was when I started working my internships in college. It was a fantastic eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>
Before starting, I was extremely nervous on how they would view me since I was Jewish. Would they be surprised? Would they make me work past sundown on Friday into the Sabbath? Do they know anything about my culture or background? Maybe I should just try to work for a Jewish company and stay in my bubble. When I came in to work my first day, something incredible happened... nothing.</p>
<p>
Nobody pointed at my Yarmulke (head covering), nobody asked me any questions about my religion, and no one thought I should move to the finance department. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew3.jpg"> They just said "Welcome Rob! We're so happy you be part of the team" and they showed me to my space and got me started with a list of tasks. This was a classic case of self-stereotyping. I put myself in a category that I though OTHERS would place me in.</p>
<p>
After being in the professional world for 4 years now, I have made it my business to treat others as I would want to be treated. Don’t see color, height, physical appearance or religion. Just look at their work and professionalism. Can they do the job? Are they polite? Can you see this person as a leader? What can you learn from them? The main rule of thumb is to be professional in a professional place and to judge people from what you know, not what you don't.</p>

<p>I can still always appriciate a good joke. :)

                            <h4>July 7th 2014</h4>

    <p>On my short road to becoming a programmer, I have learnt an important lesson- You need to know how to ask the right question. <img class="img-responsive" src="img/portfolio/Zoidberg.jpg">  It's insane how important this is. Knowing how to phrase your question could save you loads of time and frustration.
</p>
<p><strong>Scenario:</strong><br>
 Imagine you are search for an answer, a method, a syntax question, or a simple little debug issue, whatever it is. You are getting answers, but not the answers you need. You find articles and blogs and code snippets that start leading you in the wrong direction and your code takes on more errors, more bugs, and gets further from being perfect.</p>
<p>All of this could have been avoided if you took the time to understand what you are looking for and how to ask the internet for it.
</p>
<p>
    Here are the steps to creating a "good" question:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Research</strong>: Make sure you can't answer the question with simple research</li><br>
<li><strong> Title</strong>: Make sure to title your question properly in order make it easy for others to find and answer it</li><br>
<li><strong>Write your story</strong>: Don't jump write into the question and leave it at that. Help people understand your question by putting them in your place. Include code snippets, error messages, links, anything that can make the question clear. You don't want to have people who answer the questions ask you another question before answering.</li><br>
<li><strong>Grammar</strong>: be sure to check spelling and grammar before submitting the question</li><br>
<li><strong>ASK!!</strong>: Some people are too shy or embarrassed to ask a question. If you don't ask then you'll never know. Coming into the tech field I have found that it is more of a community than any other field. People are there to help. How awesome is it to get help from real people instead of robots or programs!? As the community grows, the better and more answers you will receive.  </li><br>
<li><strong>Acknowledge</strong>: Everyone loves a nice pat on the back or thank you. Remember that they helped you stop pulling your hear hair out and finally reach that moment of completion.</li>
</ul>

    When I heard about the Ruby language, I first heard of it as "Ruby on Rails". Little did I know Ruby and Rails were 2 separate entities! Ruby is the back-end programming language and Rails is an <strong> open source web application framework</strong> which runs on and is built on Ruby.
</p>
<p>Great! So, what does that mean?</p>
<p>
    Rails is the application that helps Ruby become live on the web. It makes it easier for the program to run and helps programmers by offering templates to get them started with a web page. Rails is a <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> (MVC). MVC is a design that keeps different parts of the application separated into, you guessed it, Model/ View/ and Controller. The<strong> Model</strong> interacts with the Database, the <strong>View</strong> puts the HTML code to work, and the <strong> Controller</strong> handles the interaction with the web server.
</p>
<p>
    Understood, now how do I use it?
</p>
<p>
    Following the tradition of being user friendly, Rails offers the complete package just by downloading the Rails gem on to your computer. For complete step by step instructions and a complete package of Rails, you can visit <a href="http://www.installrails.com/" target="_blank">installrails.com</a>. For simpler installation just run this code in the terminal:
</p>
<xmp>
$ gem install rails 
</xmp>
<p>
    (<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html">full instructions here</a>)
</p>
<p>
    I hope this guide helps you understand where Ruby and Rails differ and how/ why they are used together!

<p>Conflict is a rare state for me. I am extremely passive aggressive and for as long as I remember, I have always shied away from verbal or physical conflict. That being said, not everyone is like me and I have encountered individuals that would rather fight that speak their mind. Luckily, I have never been in any fist fights but I've been a part of a few "shoving" matches in my life. One episode that stands out the most was between myself and a classmate of mine. Although I was young, about 12 years old, I was stupid and let my emotions get the best of me.
</p>
<p>The event took place when I was in 8th grade. It was recess time and as an 8th grader, we were allowed use of the gym. Our go-to game was floor hockey. Some students took hockey time very seriously. They had ice hockey sticks, pads, some even were smart enough to wear helmets, and I unfortunately was not one of those smart students.  The game started and it was getting heated. Goals were being scored back and forth, checking was illegal but effective, and name calling was at an all-time high.
</p>
<p>My team was up 7-6 with about 2 minutes left on the official recess clock. I was running down the court with the puck, looking like I had the clear shot for a game deciding goal. I wound up, marked my target, and at the last second- a defender swooped in and stole the puck away. I was fuming!
</p>
<p>At that moment, a switch clicked in my brain and I only saw red. The defender had a hold of the puck and was running toward my goal. I kicked it into high gear and jetted as fast as I could towards him. Payback was the only thing on my mind. He gets to a point where he was able to load up for a slap shot in front of the goal. Now it was my turn to crush his dreams. I jump in front of him, knock the puck way out of his reach, and feel something hit me directly in the face.

<p>I must have flown 5 feet in the air with my back to ground. I land and the world goes black. I woke up with everyone around me speechless. I feel supreme pain on the back of my head and in my mouth. I slowly sat up and felt the back of my head, there was a small Mount Everest growing. Next, I felt a weird cold feeling in my mouth, I took my tongue and touched the front of my mouth. What I felt scared me and confused me. My front teeth were cut in half.

<p>My actions that day shaped the way I will live the rest of my life. I will always second guess my immediate emotional response and think of all the potential outcomes before acting. If I could go back, I would have done things much differently. If I just took one second to think "how important is this game?" and "What good can come out of this" I would still have my original 2 front teeth and dodged many awkward moments of the future (mainly, my teeth being continuously knocked out).

<p>I learnt that the action- emotion- response time should be drawn out instead of immediate. There are many ways to handle  immediate emotion- take 3 breaths, don't respond to an email for 24 hours, workout, etc. Hopefully I never encounter anything like that situation again but if I do, I'll be sure to play out the conclusion in my head before reacting (or just wear a helmet).
