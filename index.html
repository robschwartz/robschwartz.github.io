That's me up there. I'm a Chicago native that has been living here for 27 years. I had a short stint in NYC which really helped me appriciate where I came from. I love Chicago and all it has to offer. Check me out on social media and dive into my background. <br>

<!-- First Site Review-->

<h1 id="header">First Site Review </h1>
	
	<h4 id="date"> May 14th 2014</h4>
	
	<div class="content"><p>
	Below are a list of my favorite sites. Some you might agree with, some you might find yourself lost in.

<h2 class="link"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></h2>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRo4ONMmF-RIfY_3qVgbIC_mTBH9j980FknVcfNh_5ByCFhiU6ffbdJfg"></a>		</br>

 
It's a great source for pretty much anything you need. Just be careful when visiting, people tend to get sucked into the site and end up staying on there for much longer than they intended. 
The thumbnails are the most attractive to me. It gives you just enough of a preview to tickle your curiosity. The taglines are the most important but people gravitate to pictures faster than words. 
<ul>
	<li>Light</li>
	<li>Roomy</li>
	<li>Structured</li>
	<li>Basic</li>
	<li>Easy</li>
</ul> 
<img id="pic" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJSr8tw9oT9SmlDQDXebHqGVDTFRD0G6CAoA7W8QkFCB1SGW_bmqIcV7ggpA">
It solves the horrible disease of having too much time. It has everything! Just do a quick search, I guarantee it has something you would be interested in. 
I definitely see this as a time-waster, but in a good way.  
That's the great thing about this site! You don't come here for a specific reason, you come to see what has changed since the last time you were there! You can choose different categories to specify what you want to see but I mainly scroll through the pages until something catches my eye. 
Extremely easy. No bells and whistles, only content. 
Like I had a good time but probably should have been doing something else
It does not sell anything.

<h2 class="link"></a><a href="http://www.dansdeals.com/" target="_blank">Dan's Deals</a></h2> 
<a href="http://www.dansdeals.com/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF1AGx3hW2VYgSJFhSHA3NScO-OzmZdyEYSDvBbGew_BKX2_vxcYQWYTnF"></a>
</br>
Ever since we moved from NY to Chicago, my wife (who is from Montreal) and I have been trying to find cheap and easy ways to fly her home. This site teaches you tricks and tips on how to manufacture spending and purchase cheap miles! Sometimes they just have really awesome deals. I flew from ORD to Montreal for $75 round trip!!
The main content really attracts my eye the most. It is the most important area of the web page. Even though it's not very decorated, it gives me what I need. 
<ul> 
<li>Simple</li>  
<li>Pleasent</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Empty</li>
<li>Boring</li></ul>
The website is a simple blog about random internet deals, if you have a problem finding deals, this solves it. The content is mainly posts but he has a search bar as well as ads static to the top of the page
Informative, money-saving, tricks of the trade, sneaky, useful
Not always easy to find what I am looking for. They send out Tweets of all their deals and sometimes when I check the site for that deal, I can't always find it. I wish they would compact the site to content preview form to just show the title of the deal. 
It pretty easy to browse. All there is to do is scroll up and down. 
Bored, informed, confused, anxious, excited
Doesn't sell anything
</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>

<h2 class="link"><a name="linkedin"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></h2>  
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTvWcsiouv4exqoIq-GK-yiwGUdQiXgiTeMYd93Q_yqyrnArOcn4b06sA"></a>
<br>
It's a great way to stay in touch with friends and colleagues in a professional manor. 
The main news area called "Pulse" catches my eye the most. I don't believe this is the main point of the site but it is the biggest image on the page and it is directly in the middle. 
I see this site as Simple, spaced, readable, light, easy 
It solves the issue of people wanted to stay in touch on a professional level. Where Facebook and Twitter are more social, this stays professional. The content is made up of news articles related to the working professional, and working professionals themselves. 
<ul>
	<li>Practical</li>
	<li>Informative</li>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Professional</li>
	<li>Sturctued</li>
</ul>
It's pretty simple. If I am looking for a person or company I just do a search in the search bar at the top. Being more descriptive in the search is a great way to cut down the amount of people that show up. It can get frustrating if the person or company you are looking for doesn't have a profile. 
It's easy but a bit overwhelming. There's a lot to do on the site and if you don't have a set goal, you might get lost. 
Productive
It sells deeper use of the website. I have not, I don't need it past the free use it allows

		They are solving the problem of having a ton of content. They needed to figure out how much content to have in order to have it not be cluttered. Since the site is always changing, they need it to be consistent so people are familiar with the page when they return.

	This site is similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> where they need to have constant updates since it is a relatively live blog. This site is more focused on the ads and content than the UI of the page. They just want to inform the user with their message and have them move on. Not too aestheticly pleasing but it gets their message across.

	This sites problem is understanding how to keep the user engaged. They have a ton of content but also need it remain professional since their main audience consists of working professionals. They also want to add relevant news, status updates, blog shares, people who you might be interested, and so on.

			"All-In" is a well-known phrase in the poker world. It essentially states that one is putting everything s/he has on the table and is confident that their hand is the best (or hoping the confidence will scare the other player off, but let's not remember that right now). This is how I feel the experience at DBC will be. I need to go all in. Everything on the table. Shoot for the moon and land on Mars. My impression is that this is the type of culture DBC embraces.  To become the person I envision myself to be, this is the culture I need. Bold - I am not scared to work hard or to fail, these words are said and meant but that doesn't mean I won't sweat while I'm on the bottom on the journey to the top. </p></div>
			
			<div class="content"><p>
My expectations now and forever will be that DBC is the best program I could have joined to become who I want to be. I did tons of research, was accepted to 2 other Bootcamps in the city, spoke to multiple graduates, and convinced my wife (who is very supportive and getting used to me always working) to let me join the program. I have a responsibility to myself and my family to succeed. I am extremely excited to get in house and start working with others. As we read, it is better to have 5 heads working on a project for 1 day than 1 person working on it for 5 days.
</p></div>

<div class="content"><p>
I am nervous as hell and will be the whole way through. Confidence will be my greatest struggle but I am sure the support I get from DBC will help me gain the mindset I need to succeed.

<h1 id="header">CSS Positioning</h1>
	
	<h4>May 23rd 2014</h4>
	<h3 class="content">What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h3>

	
	<p class="content">
		
One of the most frustrating concepts for my personal growth as a developer has been grasping the idea of positioning on CSS.  Do I want the image to be Relative? Absolute? Fixed? Float? Absolute in relative? What does it all mean! Then once I figure out WHERE I want it to go, I need to figure out HOW I actually get it there! It's a journey of a process but little by little I am learning more about positioning and what each one means.<br>

Here is a quick guide to understanding CSS positioning.<br><br>

*First thing to note is all CSS starts in a static position. There are preset rules that are engrained in CSS that puts your HTML as it lays. No fancy positioning, just like typing on a typewriter.<br><br>


<strong>Relative</strong>: Using relative positioning will allow you to move the block up, down, left or right relative to the webpage or the div you are working within. Remember that when you add in your numbers that it translates to, "I want the block this many pixels away from that side". So having a block Left: 20px, Top: 30px, it will show something like this:<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/Images/relative_positioning.png">
<br><br>

<strong>Absolute</strong>: This type of positioning brings your item out of any div or block and puts it exactly where you want it to be on the webpage. If it was using space inside another block, it will give up its space to the items below it. Absolute position can be useful but you be careful since it can change the whole dynamic and design of the page. You also have to make sure it is not positioned on top of other items since it will overlap them. There is a way to fix this but we will discuss that another time.<br>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/Images/absolute_positioning.png">

<br><br>
<strong>Fixed</strong> : Fixed positioning is like that little thing in your eye that floats there no matter where you look. It is setting an element to a position and it will stay at that position no matter where you scroll on the screen. You have probably seen fixed positioning in action before but haven't noticed it. A good example of this can be seen here:<br>

 <a href="http://www.discovercg.com/index.php" target="_blank">http://www.discovercg.com/index.php</a><br>
(The top bar stays when you scroll up and down on the page)<br><br>

I hope this bit of information broke it down for you and helped you understand the different types of positioning available. The best way to learn is by playing around with CSS and plugging in all the different styles to see what they do live. This is scratching the base of the mountain in terms of positioning but hopefully it helps on the journey to the top.

<!--Wireframe plan-->

<hr>
<h1 id="header">My Wireframe Plan</h1> 
		<div class="content">
		<p>
			I plan on making my site as simple as possible. The sites I tend to enojy don't have a ton of razzle dazzle to them. Attached is the wireframe of how I expect my site to look. I will do my best to make it responsive and create a nice design that is pleasent to the eye. </p>
			<p>
				The basic format of the page will be a header which will be fixed to the top of the page. The header will be a way to rever back to the home page. Under the header will be the latest blog post. The post will have a header and the date under it. Content will follow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the right side of the page will be an "About Rob" section which will have my picture, a small blurb about me, and links to facebook, github, LinkedIn, and my email.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the left side will be a list of the past blog "posts" I have made. The titles will be under the "posts" header and when clicked, they will jump down to the post. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Take a look at the wireframe below: <br>
