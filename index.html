<h1 id="header">Shalom Y'all</h1><hr>
<h4>June 16th 2014</h4>
<p>
I am a practicing orthodox Jew.  If you had to guess, without knowing anything about me, what would you say I am good at? 
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew1.jpg">
<ul>
<li>A- Money Management</li> 
<li>B- Law</li> 
<li>C- Medical Science</li>
<li>D- Greed</li> 
<li>E-Comedy</li> 
</ul>
If you answered A, B, C, D, or E I would say you just stereotyped me. Without knowing me at all, just because I am Jewish, you would immediately assume I fit into one of the pre-mentioned categories. This is the definition of Stereotype Threat. It is when you are automatically categorized based on height, color, physical appearance, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>
 Labeling a person as a stereotype can immediately damage your view and relationship with that person professionally. There's a story in which a world-famous violinist, Joshua Bell, goes to play in a NY Metra station in everyday clothes. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/violin_story.jpg">No one pays attention to him and either walks by or gives him a short notice of attention. The next night, the same violinist sold out Carnegie Hall where there average ticket was $100.</p>
<p>
I grew up in a Jewish community, going to Jewish private school and a Jewish college. Pretty much anywhere I went, there was a small Jewish bubble I stayed in.
My first real exposure to the non-Jewish world was when I started working my internships in college. It was a fantastic eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>
Before starting, I was extremely nervous on how they would view me since I was Jewish. Would they be surprised? Would they make me work past sundown on Friday into the Sabbath? Do they know anything about my culture or background? Maybe I should just try to work for a Jewish company and stay in my bubble. When I came in to work my first day, something incredible happened... nothing.</p>
<p>
Nobody pointed at my Yarmulke (head covering), nobody asked me any questions about my religion, and no one thought I should move to the finance department. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew3.jpg"> They just said "Welcome Rob! We're so happy you be part of the team" and they showed me to my space and got me started with a list of tasks. This was a classic case of self-stereotyping. I put myself in a category that I though OTHERS would place me in.</p>
<p>
After being in the professional world for 4 years now, I have made it my business to treat others as I would want to be treated. Don’t see color, height, physical appearance or religion. Just look at their work and professionalism. Can they do the job? Are they polite? Can you see this person as a leader? What can you learn from them? The main rule of thumb is to be professional in a professional place and to judge people from what you know, not what you don't.</p>

<p>I can still always appriciate a good joke. :)

  <h1 id="header">Modules vs Classes</h1><hr>

    <h4>June 16th 2014</h4>
  <p>
The past week, I challenged myself with understanding and implementing Ruby Classes. This week we learn a new similar topic: Ruby Modules. The difference/ similarities between Classes and Modules is a pretty short list from what I understand. Here's what my research led me to believe:</p>

<strong>Modules methods have a global use whereas Class methods are private to that class.</strong>
<p>
For a more complicated answer, check out the graph below:</p>
<img class="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Module%20pic.png">
<p>
The Module function is Ruby seems like a good way to DRY. You can create a universal method that you constantly use and define it, sort of like how we define variables. Then when we want to call the Module, you would use the same syntax as calling a class.</p>
 
For example we would create the Module like so:
<xmp>
module New 

#insert methods here

end 
</xmp>
 
Then call it by using the syntax below:
<xmp>
module New 

#insert methods here

end 

item = item.New()
</xmp> 
 
Hopefully this broke down Modules for you and you can run free and start building!

<h1 id="header">Head of the Class</h1><hr>  
  <h4>June 11th 2014</h4>
  <p>
  Getting into Ruby classes has been a small war with many little battle wins. The first battle was understanding why we use Ruby classes.</p>
<p> 
Ruby classes are a fantastic way to create new objects with a pre-loaded set of methods (Learning about classes in CSS helped me understand this as well since I'm more of a visual learner). Instead of defining a method for each new object you implement in the code, you can just create the object into the Class and all the methods will be pre-loaded. I know, not very clear, but hopefully an everyday example will help explain it a bit better.</p>
<p>
We will be building technology for new product on the market- a tissue counter that lets you know how many tissues are remaining in your box.</p>
<p>
Let's start by ONLY defining our new class</p>
<!-- img of class -->
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Class1.png">
<p> Not too bad, right? Not too exciting either...
Let's add an instance variables to the Class</p>
<!-- img of inst var-->
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class2.png">
<p> This bit of code creates a variable that is only recognized by the created class. With this initialize method we are bringing in outside arguments into the class. Then we convert the arguments into instance variables by adding the @ in front of the argument.
Let's move on to create a couple methods. For simplicity sake, we will create 2 methods, "sneeze" and "cold". Sneeze will take 1 tissue away from the count and Cold will take away 3 tissues.</p>
<!-- img of sneeze and cold 
 -->
 <img class="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class3.png">
<p>Pretty straight forward. Let’s create a new object and see the program in action.</p> 
<!-- img of new object
 -->
 <img class="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class4.png">
 <p>
One thing to notice is after we call the 2 methods, we would be using in exsisting tissues! Let's add a rule to let us know if we have enough tissues in the box. 
</p>
<!-- img of ifs added
 --><img class="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class5.png">
<p>
 Lastly, lets add a counter method and a way to add more tissues. Then let's call all the different methods to see what they would output!
</p>
<!-- img of completed class
 --><img class="img" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class6.png">

 <p>(if you can't read any of the code, you can view the source here: <a href="https://github.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/blob/master/blog_posts/tissue_counter.rb">TissueCounter</a>)
 </p>

 <p>
  Well, that's all it took to create a fancy new tissue counter! We now have a new product that will make us millions!!! Ruby isn't too bad if you know how to use it.

An Interview with Myself</h1><hr>

<h4>June 10th 2014</h4>
<h3> Topic: DBC Pairing and Feedback</h3>
<p>
I would first like to thank my guest for coming in today and giving me the opportunity to find out the deep thoughts and insight on the topic at hand. To give a bit of background, Rob Schwartz has been a part of Dev Bootcamp's Phase_0 for the past 5 weeks and is on his way to become a full-time full-stack developer.</p>
<p>
-Rob I appreciate the time and would like to just jump right in since I know you have a lot to work on and learn.</p>

<h4>Pairing:</h4>

The first topic I would like to discuss is pairing. You have had the opportunity to pair with some other students in the cohort, about 7 up until now.<br><br>

<strong>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</strong> <br><br>
 This experience has been great. First of all I love that we are 'forced' to meet the people in our cohort before we step through the door. It already gives us a sense of unity and helps with the conversion into the bootcamp. You are going to start the school with friends already in the door.<br><br>
In terms of solving challenges, it's been very helpful. As the famous quote goes '2 heads are better than 1'. On many occasions, my partner and I are at the same level in terms of programming knowledge. By putting our minds together, we can collaborate and share what we each know and have the ability to solve the problem faster than doing it alone.<br><br>

      <strong> Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</strong><br><br>

It's always rewarding when you are able to complete the challenge together. We share aha moments and we both feel that we wouldn't have gotten there without the others help.<br><br>

<strong>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</strong><br><br>

Sometimes it's frustrating when your partner knows a bit more than you and wants to play both navigator and driver. This has happened before and even though I learn what they are doing, I feel it would be a better experience if we stuck to the roles we laid out.
<br><br>
<h3> Feedback</h3>
The next topic we will discuss is feedback. After the pairing session, you need to leave a bit of feedback on the session completed. <br><br>

<strong>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</strong> <br><br>
Some were pleasing and some were helpful. There was one that made me realize I need to do a better job at speaking up when I'm supposed to. Sometimes it’s tough to speak up when I'm not sure how to solve the problem but it's better to share your though than keep it a secret. Sometimes speaking your mind help you arrive at the answer.<br><br>

<strong>  Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</strong> <br><br>

The feedback wasn't really helpful in terms of learning, it was more about seeing how others viewed you in a situation.<br><br>

 <strong>  Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</strong><br><br>

Based on the feedback, I'll try to be more open and communicate when I see necessary. Doing the pairing over google hangouts is a bit tough since there is lag time and it might seem like we are each trying to speak over each other. I'm sure the pairing will be much more fluid in person.<br><br>

<strong>  How was it to write feedback?</strong> <br><br>

Writing feedback is a bit awkward. Even though it is anonymous, I tend to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and think they are giving it their all when pairing. No one wants to waste their time when getting together so I assume everyone has the same agenda.<br><br>

<strong>      What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</strong>  <br><br>
The most difficult part is giving actionable feedback. Giving this feedback forces you to find a flaw in the session. Sometimes it's a flawless session but then you would get a bad score for the actionable section.<br><br>

<strong> Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</strong>
<br><br>

I really enjoy pairing. I have learnt a lot and had a great time working with different people who I will spending more time with in the cohort. When we pair, everyone gains. Even if you are more senior, you use it as a refresher. We will be pairing mainly every day in the real world so this is great practice and a way to build our foundation on how to act in pairing sessions.

<h1 id="header">So Many Openings, So Few Developers</h1><hr>
	<h3>June 3 2014</h3>
	<p>
 
One of the main reasons I decided to change my life forever and become a developer is not only because I found myself enjoying learning and implementing code (there's something SOOO satisfying about writing a working function or building a complete site) but also because of the need for programmers. I currently work as a tech recruiter and every day there is a struggle to find people to fill our open jobs since everyone who can do the job is already taken!<br><br>
When I started recruiting 3 years ago, I was in limbo with what I wanted to do with my life. I majored in marketing, got a job in sales, was doing real estate on the side, and eventually moved to recruiting while still trying to figure out what I wanted to do. I figured recruiting was a great avenue to view a whole range of positions and speak to the people in the roles to find out if they enjoy their career and how they got started. Most of the developers back then has CS degrees and were life developers.<br><br>
This was a problem since companies needed developers and there weren't enough to go around. They ended up using off-shore resources that weren't as competent or a culture fit for the positions. This is an issue for a couple of reasons:<br><br>
1-      Off-shore developers usually means off-hour development<br>

2-      As we are learning in DBC, communication is key when working with teams, the distance creates an issue<br>

3-      Going off-shore gives you less control and also takes potential openings away from talented developers<br>

4-      Many more...<br><br>

This problem has been slightly rectified but the as we become more and more digital focused, the need for on-site developers has been greater than ever.<br><br>
This problem has been seen and has been rectifying itself with the emerging of boot camps and self- teaching programs. Everyday individuals can easily access these programs and teach themselves the basics of coding. The requirement for a CS degree has greatly deflated. What has become much more important is the soft skills. A company will make sure that not only are you capable of taking on the work needed, but you are a fit in their team and environment. Most companies are looking for someone who can pass, what I like to call, "The Beer Test". It's a very simple test, do you enjoy having a beer with this candidate. Think about this next time you go into an interview, since not only are they interviewing us, but we are interviewing them as well.<br><br>
I believe that in the near future, the shortage will be rectified by teaching the basics of code in grade school and giving children the opportunity to choose programming as a career. This fact makes me a bit nervous since some companies tend to get rid of the seniors if juniors can do the same objective. I see my career path growing into a management position to teach and lead the future. Tech is a ginormous field and there is room for everyone to find a home in it.

<h1 id="header">Using Enumrable#map</h1><hr>
	<h3>June 3 2014</h3>
	<p>
Ruby is full of gems that are already built in the language that make it easier to use. As a noob, it's difficult to understand what each of these methods do and how to use them in a practical setting. They seem a bit complex compared to the if/else statements we're used to but in order to be able to use Ruby to its full potential, we must make use of the tools given.</p><br>
The method we are working with is Enurable#map. Before we understand what the method is used for, we must understand what "Enumrable" actually is, I had no idea before doing some in-depth research.
Enumrable is a built in Ruby module that allows you to implement a whole list of functions once it's included into the method. One piece I notice while doing research is that in order to use the Enumrable module, you must define your #each method first. We need the each method in order to tell the Enumrable how we want it to iterate over our input.
<p>
Here is the basic each method:
<br><xmp>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
 
class Family
  attr_accessor :name, :address
  attr_accessor :father, :mother, :child
 
  # We intend to iterate over the members
  # of the family, the family name and
  # address are irrelevant here
  def each
    yield "#{@father} #{@name}"
    yield "#{@mother} #{@name}"
    yield "#{@child} #{@name}"
  end
end
 
f = Family.new
f.name = 'Smith'
f.address = '13 Main St.'
f.father = 'Bob'
f.mother = 'Alice'
f.child = 'Carol'
 
f.each do|person|
  puts person
end</xmp>
 </p>
 <p>
Once we have implemented this method we are ready to call the Enumerable module. What we need the module for is to actually put the input somewhere, whether it be an array or hash. Right now all we are doing is creating the method but it sits in cyber space until we give it a home.</p>
<p>
Here is the syntax to include the module:<br>
<xmp>
#!/usr/bin/env ruby
 
class Family
  attr_accessor :name, :address
  attr_accessor :father, :mother, :child
 
  include Enumerable
 
  # We intend to iterate over the members
  # of the family, the family name and
  # address are irrelevant here
  def each
    yield "#{@father} #{@name}"
    yield "#{@mother} #{@name}"
    yield "#{@child} #{@name}"
  end
end
 
f = Family.new
f.name = 'Smith'
f.address = '13 Main St.'
f.father = 'Bob'
f.mother = 'Alice'
f.child = 'Carol'
 
puts f.map{|p| "Family member: #{p}" }
</xmp>
</p>
 <p>
The "Include Enumrable" calls the module into the method, then at the end we call the "map" method to place the iterated material into an array.</p>
<p>
The Enumrable module is a very useful tool once you learn how to use it. There are tons of functions to call within it that will make your code clean and easy. You can find a full list here: <a href="http://ruby.about.com/gi/o.htm?zi=1/XJ&zTi=1&sdn=ruby&cdn=compute&tm=2183&f=00&su=p284.13.342.ip_&tt=29&bt=1&bts=1&zu=http%3A//ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html">ruby.about</a>
It will definitely take practice to master the language but if you learn it at little bits at a time, there is no question you can master it.</p>

<h1 id="header">Thinking in Abstract Random</h1> <hr>

<h4>May 27th 2014</h4>
<p> 
In the beginning of DBC we were asked to partake in a test to figure out our style of thinking. I never thought about how a thinking style could greatly affect how you learn but it actually makes a lot of sense. Some people are "Monkey see, monkey do" and others are "monkey read, monkey do research, monkey experiment..." you get the idea. After taking the DBC test, it spat out that my thinking style is classified as Abstract Random. I have no idea what this means but hopefully I can shed some light on this for everyone.</p>
<p>
Doing a quick google search, Abstract Random style of thinking is defined as:
<ul>
	<li>30 % of the General Population falls into this category. </li>
<li>	You are a master of unusual organization systems that nobody else can understand. </li>
<li>You experience big emotional swings and are very sensitive. </li>
<li>You are person oriented. </li>
<li>You are very creative and divergent. </li>
<li>You take being challenged personally and are likely to just "shut down". </li>
<li>Best Career Choices: Marketing, the Arts and Research & Development </li>
</ul>
This outcome is a bit template for my taste. Sort of like calling in to a fortune teller where they say generic events and hope something has to do you with you. Some of the ideas are spot on, but some are a bit of a stretch. I feel anyone can mold themselves to fit in the points above.</p>
Let's try one more:
<ul>
<li> Frequent feedback – to answer the question, "Am I on the right track?"</li>
<li>Ability to use their creativity – "I know what you want, but can I do it my way?"</li>
<li>Teamwork and collaboration</li>
<li>Acceptance and validation of their feelings</li> 
<li>Freedom from conflict</li> 
 <li>Ability to be spontaneous</li>
<li>Appreciation for their efforts</li>
<li>Freedom from competition</li>
<li>The ability to revise midstream once they have new information</li>
<li>Personalized learning that allows them to use their strengths</li>
<li>Relevance to people, to them</li>
</ul>
<p>This is much better. I feel like I can take the bullets from this source and really relate to them.</p>

<p>The biggest struggle I've had in Phase_0 is knowing if I am on the right path to success. We have been doing all this work and the only feedback we get is from our peers. What if I'm learning something completely the wrong way!? I like that with HTML/CSS you can see the work live and you know yourself if it is acting the way you want- frequent feedback.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I have to start having more faith in myself and my skills. It's nice to view other firecracker's blogs and posts since it allows you to mentally rank yourself among the others in the group. Understanding and defining my learning style was the first step. Second will be to use best practices to learn the best way that is tailored to my thinking.</p>

	<h1 id="header">JavaScript is King</h1><hr>

<p>
	<h2>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h2>
	
	<h4>May 27th 2014</h4>

If working as a tech recruiter has taught me one thing, it's that having JavaScript experience is key to the golden ticket. Every client wants a front end developer with JavaScript experience. They usually settle for someone less since most developers are using JS libraries (already created functions) such as Jquery, but if you can get down and dirty with JS, you are going to be very sought after. I always wondered why this is the case. I have seen a plethora of development portfolios, some good some bad, but of the good ones, maybe 10% actually wrote the JS themselves! I understand that you can manipulate the code more if you build it from the ground up, but essentially you get the same result. So why is JS so popular and sought after?<br><br>
It's tough to understand the importance of JS without actually knowing how it's written and the benefits it offers.  Nolan Wright, the CTO of Appcelerator, says, "In September 2012, industry analyst firm, RedMonk, showed it (JS) as the top language. Much of this is due to its ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content, its relatively lightweight and its high ease of use." The attractiveness of JS comes with is capabilities. It is easily manipulated, the code is simple, and it works on a number of platforms, especially mobile.<br><br>
JS has been found to easily convert to mobile and also change with the rapid pace of the industry. This fact alone makes it a top choice for companies since the world is moving to mobile. Another factor is the capabilities that JS has for design and UX. Since mobile design has been a hot market the past couple of years, JS has grown due to that fact it helps create a rich environment for the user.<br><br>
The next reason JS is very popular is because of its interaction with the ever popular "Cloud". JS recently released a program called "Node.js" which is a software platform that builds scalable network applications. Large companies are requiring Node.js to be the norm since there are over 35,000 downloads from the cloud each day. <br><br>

In conclusion, JavaScript is a programming language which is built on a flexible platform that is conforming to the future. It allows programmers the ability to build clean and smooth sites while making it available on both large and mobile devices. JS is easy to work with in terms of cloud development and is part of the open source community. Jquery is nice to know but programming in JavaScript should be a new <strong>must</strong> for every developer.

		<h4>May 23rd 2014</h4>
		<p>
			I plan on making my site as simple as possible. The sites I tend to enojy don't have a ton of razzle dazzle to them. Attached is the wireframe of how I expect my site to look. I will do my best to make it responsive and create a nice design that is pleasent to the eye. </p>
			<p>
				The basic format of the page will be a header which will be fixed to the top of the page. The header will be a way to rever back to the home page. Under the header will be the latest blog post. The post will have a header and the date under it. Content will follow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the right side of the page will be an "About Rob" section which will have my picture, a small blurb about me, and links to facebook, github, LinkedIn, and my email.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the left side will be a list of the past blog "posts" I have made. The titles will be under the "posts" header and when clicked, they will jump down to the post. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Take a look at the wireframe below: <br>

		They are solving the problem of having a ton of content. They needed to figure out how much content to have in order to have it not be cluttered. Since the site is always changing, they need it to be consistent so people are familiar with the page when they return.

<p>
	This site is similar to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> where they need to have constant updates since it is a relatively live blog. This site is more focused on the ads and content than the UI of the page. They just want to inform the user with their message and have them move on. Not too aestheticly pleasing but it gets their message across. 
</p>
	
<h2 class="link"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/">LinkedIn</a></h2>  
<!-- insert wireframes here-->

<p>
	This sites problem is understanding how to keep the user engaged. They have a ton of content but also need it remain professional since their main audience consists of working professionals. They also want to add relevant news, status updates, blog shares, people who you might be interested, and so on.

			"All-In" is a well-known phrase in the poker world. It essentially states that one is putting everything s/he has on the table and is confident that their hand is the best (or hoping the confidence will scare the other player off, but let's not remember that right now). This is how I feel the experience at DBC will be. I need to go all in. Everything on the table. Shoot for the moon and land on Mars. My impression is that this is the type of culture DBC embraces.  To become the person I envision myself to be, this is the culture I need. Bold - I am not scared to work hard or to fail, these words are said and meant but that doesn't mean I won't sweat while I'm on the bottom on the journey to the top. </p>
			
			<p>
My expectations now and forever will be that DBC is the best program I could have joined to become who I want to be. I did tons of research, was accepted to 2 other Bootcamps in the city, spoke to multiple graduates, and convinced my wife (who is very supportive and getting used to me always working) to let me join the program. I have a responsibility to myself and my family to succeed. I am extremely excited to get in house and start working with others. As we read, it is better to have 5 heads working on a project for 1 day than 1 person working on it for 5 days.
</p>

<p>
I am nervous as hell and will be the whole way through. Confidence will be my greatest struggle but I am sure the support I get from DBC will help me gain the mindset I need to succeed.
