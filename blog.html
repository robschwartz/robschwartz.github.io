	Below are a list of my favorite sites. Some you might agree with, some you might find yourself lost in.

<h2 class="link"><a name="reddit"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></h2>
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRo4ONMmF-RIfY_3qVgbIC_mTBH9j980FknVcfNh_5ByCFhiU6ffbdJfg"></a>		</br>

 
It's a great source for pretty much anything you need. Just be careful when visiting, people tend to get sucked into the site and end up staying on there for much longer than they intended. 
The thumbnails are the most attractive to me. It gives you just enough of a preview to tickle your curiosity. The taglines are the most important but people gravitate to pictures faster than words. 
<ul>
	<li>Light</li>
	<li>Roomy</li>
	<li>Structured</li>
	<li>Basic</li>
	<li>Easy</li>
</ul>

It solves the horrible disease of having too much time. It has everything! Just do a quick search, I guarantee it has something you would be interested in. 
I definitely see this as a time-waster, but in a good way.  
That's the great thing about this site! You don't come here for a specific reason, you come to see what has changed since the last time you were there! You can choose different categories to specify what you want to see but I mainly scroll through the pages until something catches my eye. 
Extremely easy. No bells and whistles, only content. 
Like I had a good time but probably should have been doing something else
It does not sell anything.

<h2 class="link"><a name="dansdeals"></a><a href="http://www.dansdeals.com/" target="_blank">Dan's Deals</a></h2> 
<a href="http://www.dansdeals.com/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQF1AGx3hW2VYgSJFhSHA3NScO-OzmZdyEYSDvBbGew_BKX2_vxcYQWYTnF"></a>

Ever since we moved from NY to Chicago, my wife (who is from Montreal) and I have been trying to find cheap and easy ways to fly her home. This site teaches you tricks and tips on how to manufacture spending and purchase cheap miles! Sometimes they just have really awesome deals. I flew from ORD to Montreal for $75 round trip!!
The main content really attracts my eye the most. It is the most important area of the web page. Even though it's not very decorated, it gives me what I need. 
<ul> 
<li>Simple</li>  
<li>Pleasent</li>
<li>Compact</li>
<li>Empty</li>
<li>Boring</li></ul>
The website is a simple blog about random internet deals, if you have a problem finding deals, this solves it. The content is mainly posts but he has a search bar as well as ads static to the top of the page
Informative, money-saving, tricks of the trade, sneaky, useful
Not always easy to find what I am looking for. They send out Tweets of all their deals and sometimes when I check the site for that deal, I can't always find it. I wish they would compact the site to content preview form to just show the title of the deal. 
It pretty easy to browse. All there is to do is scroll up and down. 
Bored, informed, confused, anxious, excited
Doesn't sell anything

<h2 class="link"><a name="linkedin"></a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></h2>  
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/nhome/"><img src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTTvWcsiouv4exqoIq-GK-yiwGUdQiXgiTeMYd93Q_yqyrnArOcn4b06sA"></a>

It's a great way to stay in touch with friends and colleagues in a professional manor. 
The main news area called "Pulse" catches my eye the most. I don't believe this is the main point of the site but it is the biggest image on the page and it is directly in the middle. 
I see this site as Simple, spaced, readable, light, easy 
It solves the issue of people wanted to stay in touch on a professional level. Where Facebook and Twitter are more social, this stays professional. The content is made up of news articles related to the working professional, and working professionals themselves. 
<ul>
	<li>Practical</li>
	<li>Informative</li>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Professional</li>
	<li>Sturctued</li>
</ul>
It's pretty simple. If I am looking for a person or company I just do a search in the search bar at the top. Being more descriptive in the search is a great way to cut down the amount of people that show up. It can get frustrating if the person or company you are looking for doesn't have a profile. 
It's easy but a bit overwhelming. There's a lot to do on the site and if you don't have a set goal, you might get lost. 
Productive
It sells deeper use of the website. I have not, I don't need it past the free use it allows
