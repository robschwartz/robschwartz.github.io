		They are solving the problem of having a ton of content. They needed to figure out how much content to have in order to have it not be cluttered. Since the site is always changing, they need it to be consistent so people are familiar with the page when they return.

	This site is similar to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> where they need to have constant updates since it is a relatively live blog. This site is more focused on the ads and content than the UI of the page. They just want to inform the user with their message and have them move on. Not too aestheticly pleasing but it gets their message across.

	This sites problem is understanding how to keep the user engaged. They have a ton of content but also need it remain professional since their main audience consists of working professionals. They also want to add relevant news, status updates, blog shares, people who you might be interested, and so on.
