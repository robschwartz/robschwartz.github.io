		<h2>It begins...</h2>
		<h3>The story of how one man</h3>
		<h4>followed his instincts</h4>
		<h5>and completely changed his life</h5>
		<h6><em>forever</em></h6>
		<p>He started out as a recruiter, the one finding the talent for really cool and creative jobs. He decided that finding the talent was not his calling, it was becoming the talent found.</p>
		<p>He embarked on his journey by teaching himself a bit of programming but soon realized he would need some help. <strong> Dev bootcamp </strong> was the answer he was looking for.</p>
