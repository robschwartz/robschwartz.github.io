			I plan on making my site as simple as possible. The sites I tend to enojy don't have a ton of razzle dazzle to them. Attached is the wireframe of how I expect my site to look. I will do my best to make it responsive and create a nice design that is pleasent to the eye. </p>
			<p>
				The basic format of the page will be a header which will be fixed to the top of the page. The header will be a way to rever back to the home page. Under the header will be the latest blog post. The post will have a header and the date under it. Content will follow. 
			</p>
			<p>
				On the right side of the page will be an "About Rob" section which will have my picture, a small blurb about me, and links to facebook, github, LinkedIn, and my email.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the left side will be a list of the past blog "posts" I have made. The titles will be under the "posts" header and when clicked, they will jump down to the post.
