	<h2>Why is JavaScript so popular in web development?</h2>

If working as a tech recruiter has taught me one thing, it's that having JavaScript experience is key to the golden ticket. Every client wants a front end developer with JavaScript experience. They usually settle for someone less since most developers are using JS libraries (already created functions) such as Jquery, but if you can get down and dirty with JS, you are going to be very sought after. I always wondered why this is the case. I have seen a plethora of development portfolios, some good some bad, but of the good ones, maybe 10% actually wrote the JS themselves! I understand that you can manipulate the code more if you build it from the ground up, but essentially you get the same result. So why is JS so popular and sought after?<br><br>
It's tough to understand the importance of JS without actually knowing how it's written and the benefits it offers.  Nolan Wright, the CTO of Appcelerator, says, "In September 2012, industry analyst firm, RedMonk, showed it (JS) as the top language. Much of this is due to its ability to deliver rich, dynamic web content, its relatively lightweight and its high ease of use." The attractiveness of JS comes with is capabilities. It is easily manipulated, the code is simple, and it works on a number of platforms, especially mobile.<br><br>
JS has been found to easily convert to mobile and also change with the rapid pace of the industry. This fact alone makes it a top choice for companies since the world is moving to mobile. Another factor is the capabilities that JS has for design and UX. Since mobile design has been a hot market the past couple of years, JS has grown due to that fact it helps create a rich environment for the user.<br><br>
The next reason JS is very popular is because of its interaction with the ever popular "Cloud". JS recently released a program called "Node.js" which is a software platform that builds scalable network applications. Large companies are requiring Node.js to be the norm since there are over 35,000 downloads from the cloud each day. <br><br>

In conclusion, JavaScript is a programming language which is built on a flexible platform that is conforming to the future. It allows programmers the ability to build clean and smooth sites while making it available on both large and mobile devices. JS is easy to work with in terms of cloud development and is part of the open source community. Jquery is nice to know but programming in JavaScript should be a new <strong>must</strong> for every developer.
