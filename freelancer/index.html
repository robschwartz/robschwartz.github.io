One piece of advice <strong>BE AGILE</strong><br><br>
    I believe the ability to be agile in life is the key to happiness. We stress our minds in different situations that we believe are out of our control.<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Serenity.png"> Stress leads to uncertainty and uncertainty leads to fear. If we can morph with the situation, keep calm during stressful times, and hit the curveballs, we would be able to believe nothing is out of our power. When we are in control, we have the mindset that life is going as planned which in turn, makes us happy we are living as we are supposed to.
</p>
<p>
    In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ---- x5 Agree

    I'm a pretty good cook. My friends know this and whenever they need a recipe or a new idea, they usually come to me for advice. Most recently, a friend of mine was throwing a dinner party and wanted to know what he could make that would get people talking. I mentioned a great honey nut chicken recipe that people love and he was in. It was the day of the dinner party and he called me frantic, he forgot to go out and buy nuts, one of the key <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Fried-Chicken.jpg"> ingredients and he didn't have anything else to make the chicken with. He also didn't have much time. I thought for a second and asked what else he had in his apartment he can bread the chicken with, it wasn't much. He mentioned he had some cereal- usually make with highly "crumbable" material. I asked him what kind, and as soon as he said "Honey-Nut Cheerios" we both knew what had to be done. He turned the cereal into the coating for the chicken and it came out way better than expected, people didn't leave a leg on the plate and were talking about the whole next week. The ability to be flexible to life and the situation was a huge factor in keeping calm and getting the product delivered on time.

    My values were a major factor in my decision in joining DBC. I am in a job that has plateaued and I needed to make a change in order to grow with the world around me. Instead of waiting for the hammer to come down, I have took control of my future by jumping ahead of the curve. The fact that I have an agile mindset is helpful in understanding that there is always a way to get something done, regardless of what road blocks present themselves.

<p>
    I know there will be times when I feel like I'm drowning or behind or not as talented as the person next to me but I need to remember that there is more to us than code. We have personalities, we have knowledge, we have a life. In my experience as a recruiter, I have found that there is a position for everyone. Even if you go through 50 no's, there will be 1 yes- that's all you need, just 1. Be flexible and continue the mindset where you are in control of your career.

                            <h2>Comparing Databases- SQL vs NoSQL</h2>
                            <hr class="star-primary">

    <h4>June 26th 2014</h4>
<p>
This week we are diving into the deep end of databases, specifically SQL. This is our first experience with databases so I chose to learn about both SQL and NoSQL to make sure that I would use the most appropriate DB when creating my next program. Here are my findings on both DBs:</p>
<!-- (Add pic) -->
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/NOSQL_vs_SQL.png">
<p>
<strong>SQL</strong>: SQL is a relational database which means it uses relations (usually called tables) to store data. SQL matches data by using common characteristics to place them together. The result is called a 'Schema'. SQL is a program that manages all the data that is found within the relational database. It let's you store and receive all the data that it holds.<br><br>
<strong>Here are the 4 main features of SQL:</strong> 
<ol>
<li>     A relational database is a set of tables containing data fitted into predefined categories.</li>
<li>     Each table contains one or more data categories in columns.</li>
<li>     Each row contains a unique instance of data for the categories defined by the columns.</li>
<li>   User can access data from the database without knowing the structure of the database table.</li></ol>
 </p>
<strong>Advantages of SQL Database</strong>
<ul>
<li>SQL base RDBMS are excellent in terms of providing atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability</li>
<li>It can very easily handle large volume of transaction with high level of accuracy.</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
SQL is limited on its scalability and complexity since it needs to be stored on multiple servers that can be expensive and difficult to maintain. SQL also forces us to use a table to hold our information. If it’s not in a table format, you need to change the data to be in table format which can be very annoying.</p>

Let's take a look at the other spectrum of the DB world, NoSQL<br>
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/nosql.png">
<p><strong> NoSQL</strong>: NoSQL is a class of databases that veer away from the SQL structure. This has become more popular nowadays since these databases can be written without the stored data being in a table format. These databases are more of a "one size fits all" type format. The way the data is viewed/ stored without the table format is either document based, key-value pair based, graph database, or Wide Column Stored. This allows the data entered to be flexed into any type of schema without too much configuration.</p>
<!-- (Put img of diff data pics) -->


<p>Nowadays, we have been moving over to NoSQL since it has the more flexible attributes and is better at storing large amounts of data (big data).</p>

<strong>Here are the top advantages of NoSQL:</strong>
<ol> 
<li>NoSQL databases generally process data faster than relational databases.</li>

<li>NoSQL databases are also often faster because their data models are simpler.</li>

<li>Major NoSQL systems are flexible enough to better enable developers to use the applications in ways that meet their needs.</li></ol>

<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/facing_off_sql.jpg">
<p>
In conclusion they are both great Database programs for what they were built for. A developer needs to look at his project and the type of data he will need to store in order to understand which would be the better option. With all development tools, each has their pros and cons, you just need to decide which is more valuable to you.</p>
<p>
For more on NoSQL Database have a look at Brian's NoSQL presentation. It's funny!

<p>
I am a practicing orthodox Jew.  If you had to guess, without knowing anything about me, what would you say I am good at? 
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew1.jpg">
<ul>
<li>A- Money Management</li> 
<li>B- Law</li> 
<li>C- Medical Science</li>
<li>D- Greed</li> 
<li>E-Comedy</li> 
</ul>
If you answered A, B, C, D, or E I would say you just stereotyped me. Without knowing me at all, just because I am Jewish, you would immediately assume I fit into one of the pre-mentioned categories. This is the definition of Stereotype Threat. It is when you are automatically categorized based on height, color, physical appearance, religion, and so on.</p>
<p>
 Labeling a person as a stereotype can immediately damage your view and relationship with that person professionally. There's a story in which a world-famous violinist, Joshua Bell, goes to play in a NY Metra station in everyday clothes. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/violin_story.jpg">No one pays attention to him and either walks by or gives him a short notice of attention. The next night, the same violinist sold out Carnegie Hall where there average ticket was $100.</p>
<p>
I grew up in a Jewish community, going to Jewish private school and a Jewish college. Pretty much anywhere I went, there was a small Jewish bubble I stayed in.
My first real exposure to the non-Jewish world was when I started working my internships in college. It was a fantastic eye-opening experience.</p>
<p>
Before starting, I was extremely nervous on how they would view me since I was Jewish. Would they be surprised? Would they make me work past sundown on Friday into the Sabbath? Do they know anything about my culture or background? Maybe I should just try to work for a Jewish company and stay in my bubble. When I came in to work my first day, something incredible happened... nothing.</p>
<p>
Nobody pointed at my Yarmulke (head covering), nobody asked me any questions about my religion, and no one thought I should move to the finance department. <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/jew3.jpg"> They just said "Welcome Rob! We're so happy you be part of the team" and they showed me to my space and got me started with a list of tasks. This was a classic case of self-stereotyping. I put myself in a category that I though OTHERS would place me in.</p>
<p>
After being in the professional world for 4 years now, I have made it my business to treat others as I would want to be treated. Don’t see color, height, physical appearance or religion. Just look at their work and professionalism. Can they do the job? Are they polite? Can you see this person as a leader? What can you learn from them? The main rule of thumb is to be professional in a professional place and to judge people from what you know, not what you don't.</p>

<p>I can still always appriciate a good joke. :)

                            <h4>June 16th 2014</h4>
    <p>
The past week, I challenged myself with understanding and implementing Ruby Classes. This week we learn a new similar topic: Ruby Modules. The difference/ similarities between Classes and Modules is a pretty short list from what I understand. Here's what my research led me to believe:</p>

<strong>Modules methods have a global use whereas Class methods are private to that class.</strong>
<p>
For a more complicated answer, check out the graph below:</p>
<img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Module%20pic.png"> For a larger view click <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Module%20pic.png">here</a>
<p>
The Module function is Ruby seems like a good way to DRY. You can create a universal method that you constantly use and define it, sort of like how we define variables. Then when we want to call the Module, you would use the same syntax as calling a class.</p>
 
For example we would create the Module like so:
<xmp>
module New 

#insert methods here

end 
</xmp>
 
Then call it by using the syntax below:
<xmp>
module New 

#insert methods here

end 

item = item.New()
</xmp> 
 
Hopefully this broke down Modules for you and you can run free and start building!

    <p>
    Getting into Ruby classes has been a small war with many little battle wins. The first battle was understanding why we use Ruby classes.</p>
<p> 
Ruby classes are a fantastic way to create new objects with a pre-loaded set of methods (Learning about classes in CSS helped me understand this as well since I'm more of a visual learner). Instead of defining a method for each new object you implement in the code, you can just create the object into the Class and all the methods will be pre-loaded. I know, not very clear, but hopefully an everyday example will help explain it a bit better.</p>
<p>
We will be building technology for new product on the market- a tissue counter that lets you know how many tissues are remaining in your box.</p>
<p>
Let's start by ONLY defining our new class</p>
<!-- img of class -->
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/Class1.png">
<p> Not too bad, right? Not too exciting either...
Let's add an instance variables to the Class</p>
<!-- img of inst var-->
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class2.png">
<p> This bit of code creates a variable that is only recognized by the created class. With this initialize method we are bringing in outside arguments into the class. Then we convert the arguments into instance variables by adding the @ in front of the argument.
Let's move on to create a couple methods. For simplicity sake, we will create 2 methods, "sneeze" and "cold". Sneeze will take 1 tissue away from the count and Cold will take away 3 tissues.</p>
<!-- img of sneeze and cold 
 -->
 <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class3.png">
<p>Pretty straight forward. Let’s create a new object and see the program in action.</p> 
<!-- img of new object
 -->
 <img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class4.png">
 <p>
One thing to notice is after we call the 2 methods, we would be using in exsisting tissues! Let's add a rule to let us know if we have enough tissues in the box. 
</p>
<!-- img of ifs added
 --><img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class5.png">
<p>
 Lastly, lets add a counter method and a way to add more tissues. Then let's call all the different methods to see what they would output!
</p>
<!-- img of completed class
 --><img class="jpg" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/master/blog_posts/images/class6.png">

 <p>(if you can't read any of the code, you can view the source here: <a href="https://github.com/robschwartz/robschwartz.github.io/blob/master/blog_posts/tissue_counter.rb">TissueCounter</a>)
 </p>

 <p>
    Well, that's all it took to create a fancy new tissue counter! We now have a new product that will make us millions!!! Ruby isn't too bad if you know how to use it.

<h4>June 10th 2014</h4>
<h3> Topic: DBC Pairing and Feedback</h3>
<p>
I would first like to thank my guest for coming in today and giving me the opportunity to find out the deep thoughts and insight on the topic at hand. To give a bit of background, Rob Schwartz has been a part of Dev Bootcamp's Phase_0 for the past 5 weeks and is on his way to become a full-time full-stack developer.</p>
<p>
-Rob I appreciate the time and would like to just jump right in since I know you have a lot to work on and learn.</p>

<h4>Pairing:</h4>

The first topic I would like to discuss is pairing. You have had the opportunity to pair with some other students in the cohort, about 7 up until now.<br><br>

<strong>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</strong> <br><br>
 This experience has been great. First of all I love that we are 'forced' to meet the people in our cohort before we step through the door. It already gives us a sense of unity and helps with the conversion into the bootcamp. You are going to start the school with friends already in the door.<br><br>
In terms of solving challenges, it's been very helpful. As the famous quote goes '2 heads are better than 1'. On many occasions, my partner and I are at the same level in terms of programming knowledge. By putting our minds together, we can collaborate and share what we each know and have the ability to solve the problem faster than doing it alone.<br><br>

      <strong> Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</strong><br><br>

It's always rewarding when you are able to complete the challenge together. We share aha moments and we both feel that we wouldn't have gotten there without the others help.<br><br>

<strong>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</strong><br><br>

Sometimes it's frustrating when your partner knows a bit more than you and wants to play both navigator and driver. This has happened before and even though I learn what they are doing, I feel it would be a better experience if we stuck to the roles we laid out.
<br><br>
<h3> Feedback</h3>
The next topic we will discuss is feedback. After the pairing session, you need to leave a bit of feedback on the session completed. <br><br>

<strong>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</strong> <br><br>
Some were pleasing and some were helpful. There was one that made me realize I need to do a better job at speaking up when I'm supposed to. Sometimes it’s tough to speak up when I'm not sure how to solve the problem but it's better to share your though than keep it a secret. Sometimes speaking your mind help you arrive at the answer.<br><br>

<strong>  Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</strong> <br><br>

The feedback wasn't really helpful in terms of learning, it was more about seeing how others viewed you in a situation.<br><br>

 <strong>  Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</strong><br><br>

Based on the feedback, I'll try to be more open and communicate when I see necessary. Doing the pairing over google hangouts is a bit tough since there is lag time and it might seem like we are each trying to speak over each other. I'm sure the pairing will be much more fluid in person.<br><br>

<strong>  How was it to write feedback?</strong> <br><br>

Writing feedback is a bit awkward. Even though it is anonymous, I tend to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and think they are giving it their all when pairing. No one wants to waste their time when getting together so I assume everyone has the same agenda.<br><br>

<strong>      What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</strong>  <br><br>
The most difficult part is giving actionable feedback. Giving this feedback forces you to find a flaw in the session. Sometimes it's a flawless session but then you would get a bad score for the actionable section.<br><br>

<strong> Overall, what do you think of using pairing and feedback to guide your learning?</strong>
<br><br>

I really enjoy pairing. I have learnt a lot and had a great time working with different people who I will spending more time with in the cohort. When we pair, everyone gains. Even if you are more senior, you use it as a refresher. We will be pairing mainly every day in the real world so this is great practice and a way to build our foundation on how to act in pairing sessions.
